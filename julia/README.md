###  experiments in math

Follow along as I try to keep up with Steve Brunton ( https://www.youtube.com/c/Eigensteve ), and
his classes *Beginning Scientific Computing* (AMATH 301) and *Engineering Mathematics* (ME 564).  He does
the assignments in Matlab, but I attempt to do them in Julia/Pluto.

Warmup with

    using Pluto
	using Plots
	using LinearAlgebra
	using Random
	using ODE
	Pluto.run()
